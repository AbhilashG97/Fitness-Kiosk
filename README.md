# :muscle: :weight_lifting_woman: Awesome Fitness Kiosk :weight_lifting_man: :muscle:

In this new millennium where the whole world is available right at your fingertips, physical inactivity is an alarming issue. Physical inactivity is the second highest cause of preventable death in the world. Lack of exercise can result in a variety of detrimental effects, including depression and even increases your risk of death.

## :bulb: Idea 

Our fitness kiosk is designed to keep track of the user's physical health and also suggest activities to improve his/her overall physical health.

## :star: Solution 

Our proposed device will also display potential health risks that our users may run into owing to their current lifestyle. Depending on the BMI index for a particular user, we will suggest an exercise and nutrition plan which the user can follow to transition to the healthier side of BMI index. 

The exercise and nutrition plan will be sent to the user through a mobile app. The app will keep track of the userâ€™s daily progress. 

The app will also display other details to the user such as body temperature, pulse, height, weight, BMI.
